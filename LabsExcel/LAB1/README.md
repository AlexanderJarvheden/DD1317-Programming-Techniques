## Structuring
The Unicorn Store™, a hip new startup has appointed you as their CFO, and it is your job to
estimate the company’s profit and liquidity for the next couple of months. The hype-factor is huge, 
and sales this first month are expected to reach TSEK 1 000 with a continued monthly growth of 8% thereafter.

The company has rent and other fixed costs of TSEK 350 every month. The variable costs are expected to remain 
at 70% of the revenue. Customers pay by invoice, so any money billed will not come into the company account until
one month later.

To finance the starting face, the company has taken up a loan of MSEK 1.5. We can assume it will come in as a payment 
the very first month. Every month thereafter, the company must repay this loan. To make this assignment less complicated, 
we assume that the amortizations are independent of the size of the loan and goes on in perpetuity. Amortizations is as 
such fixed at TSEK 100 per month and should be added to outgoing payments.

### Cash flow, i.e. the change in the cash register is defined as:
#### monthly incoming payments - monthly outgoing payments
The cash register will for the first month be the same as the cash flow, since we start without any money. Other months 
it’s defined as the cash register for the previous month plus this month’s cash flow. The money that we have by the end 
of April will be the money we had at the end of March plus whatever money was lost or gained throughout April.

## Analysis
The CEO wonders if the suggested loan will be enough to get the company up and running. Is the loan big enough? 
(Use Goal Seek to calculate exactly how big the loan has to be given that all estimates this far have been perfect).

## Presentation
Make sure all the data is shown with two decimals (other aesthetically appealing options are also acceptable) and make 
sure the report looks orderly enough to be presented for the board of directors (teachers). Make sure all your constants 
(A1-A5) can be changed and that the rest of the sheet updates accordingly (Goal Seek being an exception). Keep the model 
as dynamic as possible, make sure you use reference where applicable. You are expected to be able to answer questions 
about the calculations and analysis, so be prepared.
